## BolNiverse Fight Club
## Gaming Project Part 2

### Pabitra Bhandari

### Project Description:
This assignment is being continued from our initial take on the Gaming Project. In this version we are using the dynamic runtime polymorphism. Any BolNiverse defender currently fighting will be ruled by Captain Base, who uses his magical ability to take over other characters during a battle with the attackers. So from now when we see Attacker we know they are the bad people and are attacking BolNiverse and when we see Defender they are the good people defending BolNiverse. Attackers are generated from a file. Defenders are created depending on how many attackers there are.
