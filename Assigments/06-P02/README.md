## MyVector Program 2

### Pabitra Bhandari

## Project Description:

This assignments uses program from previous assignment (P01) to create a more robust MyVector class that includes some added functionality with the overloading of some C++ operators. It uses the following operators:

Overload << (ostream) so that printing to std out is easy.

Overload << (ofstream) so that printing to outfile is easy.

Overload [] so that your MyVector` can be treated as an array

Overload + (addition)

Overload - (subtraction)

Overload * (multiplication)

Overload / (division)

Overload == (equality)

Overload = (assignment)
